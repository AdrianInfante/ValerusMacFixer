### Instructions

**1. Search for Duplicate MAC Addresses in Logs**

- You no longer need to manually search the logs for duplicate MAC addresses. Simply click the button under **Step 1** to initiate a system-wide search for any duplicate MAC addresses.

**2. Populated IP Devices List**

- If duplicates are found, they will appear in a list format under the **Log Results** section.
- Only the IP addresses related to duplicate MAC address entries will be displayed for easy identification.

**3. Device Information Display**

- Click on any IP address in the **Log Results** section to view detailed information about the device, helping you resolve common issues.
  
  The displayed information includes:
  
  - **Camera IP**: The IP address from the Log Results list.
  - **MAC Address**: The MAC address recorded in the Valerus database.
  - **ARP MAC Address**: The correct MAC address retrieved from an `ARP -a` command. If the device is offline, the address will be highlighted in red with an "offline" message.
  - **System Unique ID (SUID)**: The SUID as shown in the Valerus database.

**4. Fixing Duplicate Entries**

- Press the **Replace SUID** button to substitute the existing SystemUniqueID with the correct MAC address.
- Upon completion, a notification will appear in the terminal at the bottom of the screen, confirming the update.
